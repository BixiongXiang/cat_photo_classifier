# cat_photo_classifier
Personal pet cat photo classifier, which will train a CNN model to classify a photo whether it is the pet cat or not. 
This greatly help a person to arrange its album. And also for video editor, this tool can help them to quickly find out where the cat appears so as to accelerate the editing process.

### Though accuracy is not ideal, this can still save a lot of human effort to classify photos taken by their phone

my training result:
total data set number: 2974(1511 is true), all image is taken by my own phones, so will not provide the data set.
